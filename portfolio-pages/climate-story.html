                                threat has been looming over us for so
                                long, and we’ve learned every narrative: we know about the polar bears, the scientists,
                                the corporations, the protests, the optimists proclaiming that “every little bit helps,”
                                the pessimists saying the tipping point has already passed. The stories we hear are
                                great at sparking terror, guilt, rage, desperation, and, ultimately, apathy.</p>

                <p class="portfolio-details basic-padding"> Meghan created this publication to showcase
                    Albertan perspectives on, relationships with, and emotions about climate change. In
                    partnership with the Southern Alberta Art Gallery (SAAG) and with support from the
                    Lethbridge Public Interest Research Group (LPIRG), she conceptualised
                    the project, created the call for submissions, selected contributors from the pool of
                    applicants, designed the physical publication (ensuring the layout served the presentation
                    of its contributors' diverse submissions), handled copywriting and editing/proofreading, and
                    assisted with the marketing and dissemination of the completed book.</p>
                <p class="portfolio-details basic-padding">
                    <i>Our Climate Story</i> showcases a variety of creative media (e.g., essays, collage,
                    poetry, photography) from Albertan creatives, especially highlighting post-secondary
                    students. It shares a story about climate change that balances the urgency of the
                    need to act with the belief that taking action is possible and meaningful. Focusing on the
                    down-to-earth, the personal, and the emotional, it encourages community solidarity by
                    providing the reader with a directory of organisations and resources with which to connect
                    to take the next step in their own climate journey.
